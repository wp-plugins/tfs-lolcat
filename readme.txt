A text filter that will convert your posts and comments to LOLcat-style language.

== Description ==
This is an extension of Dougal Campbell's <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/08/30/text-filter-suite">Text Filter Suite</a>, which is required for TFSLOLcat to work.  Posts and comments can be changed to LOLcat-style language.  By default, all posts and comments will be switched on the official LOLcat Day of 07 July (7-07 is LOL upside-down).

Visit the <a href="http://ben-kt.momillett.org/tfslolcat/">plugin homepage</a> for additional information.

== Installation ==
